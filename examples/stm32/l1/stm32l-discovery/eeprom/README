Console on PA2/PA3 (tx/rx)  115200@8n1

* Prints the ADC value on PA0 (adc channel 0) on the console
* Prints the ADC value on PA1 (adc channel 1) on the console
* Echos a value saved in eeprom to DAC channel 2 (PA5)
* When "user" button is pressed, current value of adc0 is stored in eeprom.

Expected: set a value on adc0, press the button, see that adc1 switches to
"match".  Unplug, replug, see that adc1 still shows prior value.

Recommended wiring:
* pot or any resistor ladder to PA0
* jumper from PA5 to PA1

By default, this builds in semihosting mode, for ease of testing.
