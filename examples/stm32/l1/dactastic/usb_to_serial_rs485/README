This example implements a USB CDC-ACM device, connected to USART1 (PB6/7)
DMA is used to transfer from USB rx side to the USART tx,
Interrupts are used from USART rx to fill the USB tx side.
Baud rates from 600-921600 are tested, as well as even/odd/no parity

A GPIO is toggled around USART transmissions to control an RS485 line
transceiver, following ST's app note. The RS485 driver enable line is,
by default, PB1

A scope shows this perfectly following ST's notes, but some rs485 hardware isn't fast enough for this :(
we can't do the regular 1ms pre, 4 ms post delay, as we're inside IRQ context, need to queue a callback to run in
userspace to do the rest of it. (Which means we need dual buffering dma at some point...)

The blue LEDs indicate tx/rx activity, but especially for the rx line,
you won't really see it without heavy data rates.

This example is heavily based on the existing usb_cdcacm and usart demos.
